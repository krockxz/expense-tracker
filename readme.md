## **Installation and Setup**

### **Step 1: Clone the repository**

Clone the project to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krockxz/expense-tracker.git
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies for Frontend**

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in `frontend/package.json`, including **React**, **Axios**, and **TailwindCSS**.

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies for Backend**

Next, navigate to the backend directory (if you have it as a separate folder) and install the required dependencies.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in `backend/package.json`, including **Express**, **Cors**, and other necessary libraries for the backend.

### **Step 4: Configure the Environment**

- Make sure that your **API URL** is configured correctly in your frontend. The test env has been commited.

If you're using `.env` files, you can set the API URL in your frontendâ€™s `.env` file like this:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### **Step 5: Running the Application**

Now that everything is set up, you can run both the frontend and backend simultaneously.

#### **Run the Backend**:

1. Open a terminal in the **backend directory** and run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:5000` (default port).

#### **Run the Frontend**:

2. Open another terminal in the **frontend directory** and run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the frontend development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
